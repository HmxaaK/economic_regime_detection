# Economic Regime Detection & Nowcasting

This project uses **Logistic Regression** on macroeconomic indicators to nowcast the current economic regime (recession or expansion) and compute an **Economic Health Score**.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Problem
The National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) declares U.S. recessions **months after they start**. This lag makes real-time decision-making difficult for policymakers, investors, and businesses.

## ðŸ’¡ Solution
We use historical monthly macroeconomic indicators and NBER labels to train a logistic regression model. This model can:
- Estimate the probability of being in a recession *this month*.
- Convert that probability into an **Economic Health Score** (0â€“100 scale).

## ðŸ›  Features
- Feature engineering with polynomial terms, logs, and differences.
- Logistic regression with time-series cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning.
- Probability-to-score transformation for intuitive interpretation.
- Historical backtesting with visualizations.
